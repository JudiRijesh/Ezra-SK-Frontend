                        EZRA means Help or Helper in Hebrew. As the name says we have been helping the community for over 20 years (since 2001). On our website you will find more information about our organization, the methodology, and our working method.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        From our offices in Groningen and Drachten, we work with an enthusiastic and expert team. We offer specialist guidance to children, young people, families, and (young) adults who live in the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, and Drenthe under the Youth Act and WMO.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        Our experience since 2001 lies in guiding children, young people, families, and (young) adults who have already experienced a lot in their lives. Often, they have had multiple caregivers, and challenges exist across multiple areas of life, sometimes called "multi-problem" cases. This includes issues related to school, free time, work/school, upbringing, housing, or finances.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        We offer guidance at home with an expert and committed team. Your regular care provider comes when needed, where needed. Guidance can also take place at school or in the neighborhood, for example.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        The starting point is for you to direct your own life, with our support where necessary. We encourage you to take steps independently and explore how your own social network can help.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        We work without waiting lists. If you register with us, we'll set up an information meeting within a week, so you can decide if our approach is right for you.
